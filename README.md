Traffic data from North Carolina, 2013-2019

The "Full Regression Code" document contains a copy of the Stata code used to analyze the data. The "Analysis Code" document contains Stata code to produce Excess Collision predictions by variable, county, and year.

The Excel files "NC Traffic Weather Data revised - 1" (and 2 and 3) are the updated data set including pedestrian, bicycle, and vehicle counts for incidents. 

This file was broken into smaller pieces for upload to GitHub and should be combined into a single worksheet prior with 255,600 rows for all 100 counties and 2,556 days.

The Excel document "NC Traffic Weather Data final" contains the original data set of daily, county-level data for collision outcomes, weather data, and indicator variables necessary to run the Stata code.
